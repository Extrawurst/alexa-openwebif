        <h1>vibe.appmain</h1>
Provides vibe based applications with a central program entry point.
<br><br>
This module is included automatically through the import 'vibe.d'. It will provide a default
	application entry point which parses command line arguments, reads the global vibe configuration
	file, and starts the event loop.
<br><br>

	The application itself then just has to initialize itself from within a 'static this' module
	constructor and perform the appropriate calls to listen for connections or other operations.
<br><br>

	If you want to provide your own main function, you have to import vibe.vibe instead of
	vibe.d and define a -version=VibeCustomMain. Be sure to call vibe.core.core.runEventLoop
	at the end of your main function in this case. Also beware that you have to make appropriate
	calls to vibe.core.args.finalizeCommandLineOptions and vibe.core.core.lowerPrivileges to get the
	same behavior.
